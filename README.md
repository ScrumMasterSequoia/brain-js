This project is based on the youtube tutorial above, which pulls info from the brain.js repo. My version of the project includes styling and both the diagram and final product together. 
the live version of the project is rendered at 

To load project, right click index.html file and select 'Open with Live Server'

To change diagram, adjust the hiddenLayer array int parameters.

To train new data, use the appropriate buttons to select the better looking text color based on the current background. Once you find an instance where the text and background look bad together, press the print button, and the most recent data point should be the bad one in question. Assuming you pressed the correct button to select the better color when you encountered this, the new data point should be the correct value. Copy paste this value from the console log when inspecting the page and paste it into the data within the script.js file.
